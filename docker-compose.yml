    # OPTION 1: Build from GitHub (Current Default)
    # This will fetch and build the code directly from your repo
    build: https://github.com/Botched/PhotoFrameUI.git#main

    # OPTION 2: Use Pre-built Image (Fastest - Recommended once GitHub Action finishes)
    # image: ghcr.io/botched/photoframeui:latest

    # OPTION 3: Build from local files (Best for development)
    # build: .
